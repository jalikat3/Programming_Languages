# Research_Language_R

This was a team effort between my classmate Chris Warren and I. We spent the semester learning about the differences between programming languages. Throughout the course, we wrote an entire book chapter on the R programming language. R is a popular choice for data analysis and statistics due to the variety of packages that can be imported. An example program is used with the included mtcars dataset.
